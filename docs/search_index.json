Using Bookdown to Remove Barriers and Open Up Learning Kelly Marjanovic, Colin Madland &amp; Barish Golland Last updated: 2022-05-19 Workshop Description Image adapted from Wikimedia Access denied! You do not have permission to view this file! Sound familiar? Imagine how our learners must feel as they take all the necessary steps to begin a course, only to encounter barrier after barrier. Low Wi-Fi causing network disruptions, logging in to multiple sites to view resources, trying to locate a specific unit topic, and having screen display issues. In this session we will present our use of Bookdown, an open-source R package that helped us remove some of the barriers for learners and instructors. We will share how we moved some of our courses to Bookdown after hearing our Nigerian students had limited access to Moodle. We will explore the many advantages of using Bookdown, such as accessing course content outside of our LMS, providing a collaborative infrastructure for design and maintenance (GitHub), displaying content as a searchable book, and providing accessible versions (ePub/PDF). We will explore other advantages, as well as some challenges we have come across. The second half of this workshop will allow participants to present their own course challenges. Using Liberating Structures, participants will draw from the expertise of colleagues and consider recommendations to address barriers for learning. Workshop Learning Outcomes In this workshop, participants will be able to:  explore open access tools, such as Bookdown discuss advantages and disadvantages of using tools like Bookdown in courses  share their course design challenges and gain insight from others Workshop Agenda Topics Problem: Barriers to Access Solution: Bookdown format What is Bookdown?

Overview The bookdown package is an open-source R package that facilitates writing books and long-form articles/reports with R Markdown. (https://bookdown.org/) The bookdown package is built on top of R Markdown (http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), and inherits the simplicity of the Markdown syntax (see guide), as well as the possibility of multiple types of output formats (PDF/HTML/Word/). It has also added features like multi-page HTML output, numbering and cross-referencing figures/tables/sections/equations, inserting parts/appendices, and imported the GitBook style (https://www.gitbook.com) to create elegant and appealing HTML book pages. This book itself is an example of how you can produce a book from a series of R Markdown documents, and both the printed version and the online version can look professional. You can find more examples at https://bookdown.org. From bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown by Yihui Xie Process Figure 9.1: Simplified workflow to compose, compile, and publish in multiple formats with Bookdown. Images from Daniel Hendricks, RStudio, and Zotero. From Bookdown, GitHub, and Zotero by Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou Here is our workflow in creating a course in Bookdown. See Getting Started for more details. Book set-up: We set up the Bookdown files and composed the manuscript in R Markdown, the R-flavored version of the easy-to-write Markdown syntax. Each chapter consisted of one .Rmd file, with links to static images and interactive visualizations. Adding content: We upload our files to a free GitHub repository, which allows multiple authors to work simultaneously on different chapters of the book and push revisions (called commits) to a shared online repository, where authors can view each others edits. Many on our online team use Atom to add content. Many of our instructors / SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) use Word documents or Google docs for content. For Google docs, you can use the Docs to Markdown add-on to convert one-time into Markdown format, which is similar to R Markdown. For Word docs, we use the Writage plugin to convert to markdown. Building the book: After adding content (through Github or Atom), we used Bookdown to automatically knit and compile the book products. Behind the scenes, Bookdown builds the editions using the PanDoc universal document converter and the LaTeX document preparation software, without requiring you to learn these complex formats. Commit to Create! Lastly, we commit the changes through GitHub Desktop, and voila! Your book is created!

As you view the features below, consider whether you can use Bookdown to share access with learners. Accessible Open access to course materials: A Course Book created with Bookdown is a simple URL! Students do not need to login to Moodle to access the book. They can also download as a pdf or epub (discussed below), so limited wifi shouldnt be an issue. Integration with Moodle: The CourseBook can be embedded in a tab in Moodle, so students can access the book within their Moodle shell.

Checking your Learning "],["getting-started.html", " 3 Getting Started Creating your Bookdown course Creating Your Book Making Edits to Book", " 3 Getting Started Creating your Bookdown course Go to: https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo You will need the following: - R installed - Rstudio installed - GitHub account &amp; GitHub Desktop - Optional: Atom or VSCode installed See below for explanations and instructions. R &amp; RStudio RStudio is an integrated development environment for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. It is available in two formats: RStudio Desktop is a regular desktop application while RStudio Server runs on a remote server and allows accessing RStudio using a web browser. Wikipedia Install R from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ (Download R 4.1.1 for Windows or Mac, as appropriate) Download R studio (free) https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ You may need to install packages. You can do this by adding the commands to the console, or go to Tools &gt; Install Packages install.packages(rmarkdown) install.packages(rlang) install.packages(bookdown) If install doesnt work, go to source of package. e.g. https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/bookdown/index.html Git, GitHub, GitHub Desktop GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. Create a GitHub account See the GitHub tutorial Atom Atom is a free and open-source text and source code editor for macOS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows with support for plug-ins written in JavaScript, and embedded Git Control. Developed by GitHub, Atom is a desktop application built using web technologies. Most of the extending packages have free software licenses and are community-built and maintained. (Wikipedia. This is optional, but is definitely handy in creating with Bookdown. Install Atom Alternatively, install VSCode Creating Your Book If you see a Book youd like to copy/modify, then go to the repository in GitHub and fork it. To build a book from scratch, you will need to create a repository in GitHub. See the following directions from GitHub Docs Creating a repository A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets  anything your project needs. Often, repositories include a README file, a file with information about your project. README files are written in the plain text Markdown language. You can use this cheat sheet to get started with Markdown syntax. GitHub lets you add a README file at the same time you create your new repository. GitHub also offers other common options such as a license file, but you do not have to select any of them now. Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others. In the upper-right corner of any page, use the drop-down menu, and select New repository. In the Repository name box, enter hello-world. In the Description box, write a short description. Select Add a README file. Select whether your repository will be Public or Private. Click Create repository. Making Edits to Book In GitHub desktop, clone the repository to your computer. (e.g. https://github.com/ma-lead) In Atom: Edit content In RStudio: Build book, see preview In GitHub Desktop: Commit to main and Push origin "],["resources.html", " 4 Resources 4.1 Bookdown resources 4.2 Tutorial Videos:", " 4 Resources 4.1 Bookdown resources Below are some key resources for to help you create a book using Bookdown.
