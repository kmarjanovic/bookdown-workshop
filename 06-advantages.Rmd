# Bookdown Advantages

## Overview {-}
There are many advantages for using the Bookdown as a course resource. As you view the features below, consider whether you can use Bookdown to share access with learners.

##  Accessible {-}

1. **Open access to course materials:** A Course Book created with Bookdown is a simple URL! Students do not need to login to Moodle to access the book.  They can also download as a pdf or epub (discussed below), so limited wifi shouldn't be an issue.

1. **Integration with Moodle:** The CourseBook can be embedded in a tab in Moodle, so students can access the book within their Moodle shell.

1. **Mobile-friendly:** Easy to navigate on various devices.  This is especially important for our International students.

1. **Collaborative infrastructure for design & maintenance (GitHub):** GitHub allows course writers to track changes, collaborate on material, and update all versions of courses without having to edit each Moodle shell of a course.  Our TWU Online team has been using GitHub since 2018, so the integration of RStudio went fairly smoothly.
